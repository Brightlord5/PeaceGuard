"PeaceGuard: Violence Detection Platform" is a comprehensive application intended for the quick analysis and detection of violent material present in footage. The software uses deep learning techniques to evaluate video frames and identify possible instances of hostility or violence by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning models. Uploading MP4, AVI, or MKV video files allows users to use the application, which then processes and analyzes the material to forecast whether or not violence would be there.![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
